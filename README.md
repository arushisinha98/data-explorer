# data-explorer

The vision is to create a website for users to play around with data wrangling options when cleaning their tabular data sets. A user will be able to apply data wrangling methodologies to each column of their data set and visualize the effect on 1D, 2D, or 3D plots with the choice of different columns for axes.

The impetus for this project came when I wanted to explain the impact of different data cleaning and imputation strategies on model performance for my clients. Rather than apply various permutations and combinations, run a model, and display the different evaluation metrics, I decided to create an interactive platform that instead allows them to visualize the effect of such pre-processing decisions on the data distribution itself.
